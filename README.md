GESTURE-BASED MOTION CONTROL SYSTEM WITH EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION FRAMEWORK USING AI

There are about 650 million impaired people globally alone who face great vicissitude in their everyday
routines. These impaired people form a helpless minority among the handicapped population and hence, are
underprivileged for the minimal support services. These gesticulated people's capacities to navigate in their
house and communicate daily are vital for their entire lives. Organizing any
simple daily activity can be especially difficult without communication and navigation. The main aim
of this project is to create a gesture-based control system to handle the wheelchair functionality along with
effective communication systems such as Audio output SMS. The results show that the visually assistive device
converts the visual data by capturing the image and video processing into a recognition framework to
recognize the gestures that can handle wheelchair functionality and create an effective communication
framework. The gesture recognition framework, along with an integrated hardware setup, helps numbness-aided people communicate with others in emergencies, along with the movement of wheelchairs through
artificial intelligence.
