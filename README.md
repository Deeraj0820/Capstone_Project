There are about 650 million impaired people globally alone who face great vicissitude in their everyday
routine. These impaired people form a helpless minority among the handicapped population and hence, are
underprivileged for the minimal support services. These gesticulated people's capacities to navigate in their
house and to communicate in their daily activities are of vital importance for their entire life. Organizing any
kind of simple daily activity can be especially difficult without communication and to navigate. The main aim
of this project is to create a gesture-based control system to handle the wheelchair functionality along with
effective communication systems such as Audio output, SMS. The results show the visually assistive device
converts the visual data by capturing the image and video processing into a recognition framework to
recognize the gestures which can handle both wheelchair functionality along with effective communication
framework. The gesture recognition framework along with integrated hardware setup helps the numbness
aided people to communicate with others in emergencies along with movement of wheelchair through
Artificial intelligence.
